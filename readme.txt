== Description ==

This plugin will change the hungarian letters with accents to simple letters in the permalink, so the permalinks will be clean adresses and just good to be indexed by search engine robots. The plugin cleans also the symbols written with hungarian keyboards.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `hu-permalinks.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You are done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I really need this plugin? =

Basically the default WordPress software will clean the hungarian letters with accents in the permalinks, but there are many keyboards which generates "weird" fonts and even symbols. So, if you run a hungarian blog, you definitely need this small plugin, just in case.
